mesh extra — `pip install partspec`, the first minute of use — 23 tests marked

CI never saw it because no job ran the WHOLE suite without extras: `check` and
`test` install all of them, and `mesh-only`/`mcp-only` ran a single module
each. So the one environment that would show it was the one nothing ran in.
`just test-no-extras` runs everything there now, and `just test-mesh-only`
was widened to the whole suite for the same reason.
