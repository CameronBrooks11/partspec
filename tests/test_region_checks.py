"""The runner path for `keep_out` / `keep_in`, both tiers.

Split out of `test_runner.py` (#153), and named for its subject rather than its
method: it was `test_regions_e2e.py` until #159. Counting is what settled it —
of the 18 tests it held then, only 7 drove `run()`; the other 11 attack the
adjudication through `_BoxWorld`, the honest one-box stub, with no kernel at
all, so a reader filtering `_e2e` for end-to-end coverage was over-counting by
eleven. After the four attribution tests left for `test_attribution.py` the
ratio is starker still — **3 of the 14 here drive `run()`** — because the ones
that left were among the end-to-end ones. `test_region_checks` is true of every
test in this file and claims no tier.

The four per-component attribution tests that came along in the original split
have moved to `test_attribution.py`; they were #84's subject, not this one's.
`test_region_clauses_appear_as_components` stays, because a region clause
appearing as a component IS a claim about the region check.

`test_region.py` holds the region *data* (the canonical polyhedron both tiers
materialize); this file holds the runner path that consumes it.

    * The loop brackets `[0, inradius()]` and halves `_DEPTH_BISECTIONS` times,

      all. The 8x8x8 case stops 1e-2 mm short of it and is fine at any offset.
    * The coordinate's ulp then has to exceed the extent left at that probe,
      `inradius * 2**-23`. Measured: 8x400x400 is fine at x=1e9 and raises at
