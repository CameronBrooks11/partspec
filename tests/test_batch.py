    The same hazard as the test above, one field down and one release later:
    `imports` is read from `sys.modules`, so a Python part behind another one
    inherits every distribution the earlier target loaded. Measured on the
    v0.7.5 pre-tag audit, a build123d cube recorded 38 imports alone and 44
    behind a CadQuery target, `cadquery` among them — and `diff` over those
    two reports of one part said `inputs appeared: cadquery 2.8.0, casadi
    3.7.2, +4 more` at exit 0, which is a positive finding built out of the
    batch order.

    Two PYTHON-tier targets, deliberately: the guard above pairs an OpenSCAD
    part with a build123d one, and OpenSCAD emits `imports: {}`
    unconditionally, so that combination is the one that cannot catch this.

    The map itself stays wide — over-reporting never turns a real build input
    into silence, and a `sys.modules` delta would drop a library the second
    target genuinely uses because the first loaded it first. What must not be
    wide is the claim, so the closure names what it inherited.

    Three decisions inside that claim are pinned here, each of which survived
    the whole suite when mutated during review: the snapshot's boundary, the
