    `import()` reads one, and SPEC-report §8.3 says so — those paths "genuinely
    are build inputs", and may be computed at render time, so no static reader
    can resolve them. Writing the artifact over one changes what the NEXT run
    measures: with the destination consumed, the model built without its
    import and reported a confident `[5, 5, 5]` for a part that measures
    `[10, 10, 10]`, at exit 0. That is the defect #187 exists to abolish,
    reached through its own fix.

    Both spellings, because the first fix only closed one. `import_stl()` is
    deprecated and 2021.01 still runs it, and the guard's `import(` pattern
    demanded the paren straight after the name — so three consecutive runs of
    the `import_stl` model ate their own input and answered `[30,10,10]`,
    `[50,10,10]`, `[70,10,10]`, each at exit 0, with nothing on stderr.

    **The refusal is exact since #263 and the exit code is not.** It used to
    fire before the render on the mere presence of `import()`; it now fires
    after it, on the engine's own dependency list, and names the file that was
    actually read rather than the fact that some file was. `EXIT_USAGE` is
    pinned here deliberately: the same invocation was refused at 64 when the
    answer was a guess, the caller's remedy is still a different `--out`, and a
    script reading the exit code must not see a build failure where an argument
    is what is wrong.

    **`grounds` is a list because `import_stl` gets a different one per
    engine, and that is F13 rather than a choice.** 2021.01 executes the
    deprecated spelling, so the depfile names the file and the refusal is the
    exact one; the 2026.08.01 snapshot ignores it, so the render reads no data
    at all, the two accounts of the source contradict each other, and the
    refusal is the conservative one. Asserting the 2021.01 phrasing as
    universal is what the first cut of #263 did, and the matrix caught it.
    What holds on both is what a caller reads: exit 64, the donor untouched,
    and a refusal that names the file at stake.

    """#277: three verbs default beside the CONTRACT, and none of them said so.

    `--out` absent means `<contract dir>/outputs/<part-slug>`, anchored to the
    contract file rather than to the working directory -- so the same command
    run from two places writes to one place, and running it from somewhere
    unrelated creates an `outputs/` inside a project the caller may not have
    meant to touch. That rule lived only in `_out_dir`; `check --help` and
    `measure --help` described the DIR layout without ever naming the default,
    `render --out` carried no help text at all, and SPEC-report declared the
    whole question out of scope.

    Two claims, both executable. The path is what `_out_dir` builds -- the only
    place the rule is decided. And every `--out` in the parser carries help,
    which is the structural fact `render` violated, not a statement about what
    that help says.

    Deliberately NOT asserted: that the help text contains the default. An
    earlier draft did exactly that, and AGENTS.md forbids it -- a substring
    search reports a string is present, which is not a claim anyone wanted to
    make. Proven, not assumed: with `assert "outputs/<part-slug>" in help` in
    place, inverting all three sentences to "in the working directory rather
    than beside the contract" -- #277's exact error -- still passed.

    Interpolating the three helps from one `OUT_DEFAULT_DOC` removes the drift
    between them but not the drift from behaviour: a second draft claimed there
    was "nothing left to check", and setting that constant to "the current
    working directory" passed the whole suite. So the constant is pinned here:
    its middle component is derived from the directory `_out_dir` builds, and
    its "beside the contract" claim is cross-checked against
    `built.parent.parent` by a separate assertion -- that clause is retyped in
    the expected string below, not computed from anything.

    A third draft then named the two MCP docstrings as the whole of what stayed
    unpinned. Also wrong: each help interpolated the constant into a sentence
    restating the same fact in its own words, and mutating only that sentence
    to "in the working directory rather than beside the contract" -- #277's
    exact error, rendered into a self-contradicting help string -- passed all
    1170 tests. That clause now lives inside the constant, where an exact-match
    pin reaches it.

    What that buys is narrower than three drafts of this paragraph claimed, and
    was measured rather than reasoned about: the pin reads the constant and
    nothing else. Appending a second telling of the anchor to a help passes,
    and so does appending a sentence that contradicts it -- both tried, both
    green across all 1170. The helps are asserted non-empty and no more.

    Every other statement of the default -- the MCP docstrings, both docs,
    other prose, this docstring -- is unpinned. No list of them here: four
    drafts gave one and each was short by a copy the next reviewer found with
    `grep -rn "outputs/"`, which is the answer that does not go stale.
