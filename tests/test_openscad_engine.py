"""`engines/openscad.py`: the source model, the closure, and the build.

Split out of `test_mesh_backend.py`, which was nearly half coverage of this
module under a filename that named a different one (#153). The move is not
only tidiness: that file binds `trimesh` at import, so these tests — none of
which measures a mesh — could not run in an install without the mesh extra.
Here they do.

The markers are `needs_openscad`, and they track the BINARY, not the mesh
tier: nothing here reaches a measurement. The three tests that touch
`MeshBackend` all assert a `BuildError`, which is why they pass with no extras
installed at all.

What stays next door is what the name says: measurement of a mesh. What lives
here is everything about turning a `.scad` into an artifact — the literal, the
include closure, the invocation, and how a failure is reported.

    the remedy that claim implies: ask the ENGINE what it read, which is what
    `_wrote_over_an_input` does with the answer since #263. This executes
    that claim rather than asserting it in prose, on whichever binary is
    installed, which is why it is a test and not a comment. CI runs two engine
    versions (apt 2021.01 and a 2026.08.01 snapshot) and F13 is the finding
    that they differ, so a claim about engine behaviour that only ever ran on
    one of them is a claim about one machine.

    The **computed** case is the load-bearing half. A literal `import("x.stl")`
    is findable with a regex, which is roughly what `_EXTERNAL_DATA_RE` does;
    `import(names[i])` is exactly the case the bool exists to admit defeat on,
    and the deps file names it by absolute path anyway — because the engine
    reports what it opened, not what it could parse.

    Deliberately drives the binary rather than `render()`, and stays that way
    now that #226 has landed and `render()` passes `-d` itself. This is the
    ENGINE-behaviour premise the feature rests on, so it must keep failing for
    the right reason: routed through `render()` it would also fail when
    partspec's own parsing or plumbing broke, and the two are different

    45 deg about Z (measured bbox (-3.536,0,0)..(3.536,7.071,5)); calling that

    Both call sites answered `openscad not found on PATH` with "install the
    stable package, or the nightly AppImage via workstation-configs" -- the
    maintainer's provisioning repo, which appears in no README, carries no URL
    and no package name, and which grep finds nowhere else in this tree.

    What is enforced, exactly: the **named** remedies -- backticked commands
    and URLs -- must each appear in the README; at least one must be a runnable
    command or an address rather than a bare word; and a not-found hint must
    name the escape hatch. Prose is NOT checked and cannot be, so this test
    cannot make a hint useful. Its limit, quoting a string that was run:

        install it via workstation-configs, or `sudo apt install openscad`
        — or set PARTSPEC_OPENSCAD to an existing binary        <- PASSES

    because the named remedy is real and documented and the junk rides
    alongside it. What the coupling does catch is a named remedy the docs do
    not carry, or one that carried once and has gone stale.

    Three earlier drafts of this docstring overstated it, which is why the
    example above is quoted rather than paraphrased. The first claimed to
    check "every command and address the hint names" -- wider than the code,
    since prose is invisible to it. The second gave an example the fix had
    already made fail. The third dropped the escape-hatch clause from a string
    that had been run with it, leaving an example that fails on an assertion
    this paragraph did not mention. All three were written before being run.

    The coupling is one-directional on purpose: the hint is the side that must
    not invent remedies, so the hint is the constrained side. It catches both
    ways a remedy goes bad -- named but undocumented (#276), and documented
    once but since gone stale. The first fix for #276 said
    `brew install openscad`; Homebrew disables that cask on 2026-09-01, after
