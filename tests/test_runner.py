"""The runner: contract in, report out — and the internals that path relies on.

Most of this file is end-to-end. Those are the tests that would catch the tool
lying, and each asserts a claim from `SPEC-report.md` that the rest of the
design depends on.

The last section is not. `# runner internals, exercised directly` drives
`_run_geometry_check` with a stub, no engine and no report. It is here because
`runner.py` owns that helper.

This docstring says so because the #153 split added that section while the
first line still read "End-to-end" — the same false module docstring #158
retracted one file over, committed in the commit that retracted it.

# that DECLARES a primitive and then refuses it per-call, which no shipped
# backend does, so it is the only way `_refused`'s `requires=` field is
# exercised at all.
#
# It arrived here in #158 from `test_fillet_radius.py`, where the #153 split had
# filed it by the banner it sat under rather than by its subject. Two others
# arrived with it and have since gone on to `test_attribution.py` (#159), which
