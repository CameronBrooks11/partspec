# Observed CAD-as-code failure modes

**Status:** v1 · 2026-08-08 · closes #24
**Source:** the 2026-08-03–06 dogfood runs (partspec 0.1.0, 15 targets, 18-library
OpenSCAD corpus plus community CadQuery/build123d models), distilled from the scratch
workspace's `results.md`, preserved verbatim as [`notes/dogfood-results.md`][dogfood-results]. Finding
numbers (F5, F10, …) refer to that record.
**Scope:** failure modes of *CAD-as-code itself* — the ways a part goes wrong while
every tool in the chain reports success. partspec's own development bugs are deliberately
excluded (the tracker and [`notes/`][notes] carry those); this file is what an authoring agent
needs to have seen *before* writing a part.

**Workspace ruling (#24's last acceptance box):** `docs/PLAN.md` records the dogfood
workspace's untracked status as a deliberate call, and that call **stands** — it remains
a scratch corpus of third-party code. What changes is that everything load-bearing now
lives here: this catalogue is the shipped artifact, and the raw record is frozen at
[`notes/dogfood-results.md`][dogfood-results].
Entries below are marked **[repo]** when reproducible from this repository alone and
**[corpus]** when they need the external library corpus.

Every entry answers four questions: the symptom, the root cause, how it was caught, and
— the one that matters most — **what it looks like when it's green**: the exact face a
quietly-wrong part shows you.

---

## 1. A removed language construct silently deletes geometry **[corpus]**

- **Symptom.** A gear library renders a part **35% smaller in every planar dimension**
  with its teeth missing — 48.8 mm outer extent where theory says 72.2 mm, essentially a
  gear blank at pitch diameter.
- **Root cause.** The source uses OpenSCAD's `assign()`, deprecated and later *removed*.
  Modern OpenSCAD ignores an unknown module — and ignoring a module means **its children
  never render**. The children were the `polyhedron()` calls cutting the teeth. The
  library's source is unchanged and correct; the language moved underneath it.
- **Detected by.** A contract asserting the involute-gear envelope *derived from theory*
  (`teeth × outside_circular_pitch / 180`, plus addenda), run under two pinned binaries:
  PASS on 2021.01 (honours `assign`), FAIL on 2026.08.01 (ignores it). One variable. (F13)
- **When it's green.** Both versions **exit 0 and write clean, watertight, single-solid
  STLs**. The only signal is a `WARNING: Ignoring unknown module 'assign'` buried in
  stderr. No `assert()` in the library could catch it — the 18-library corpus
  contains zero asserts; the one library with any (the bayonet, 12 of them, from a
  separate collection) was the outlier, and even those only guard inputs.
- **Guards.** partspec reads the *mechanism* directly since #286: `check` and `measure`
  scan the engine's stderr for unresolved names on the path that **succeeded**, not only
  where the build had already failed, and both refuse — `verdict: "error"`, exit `4`,
  every geometry check `skipped` (`SPEC-report.md` §6.1). Before that the warning was
  read only after a failed build, so this shape was invisible: the gear above was caught
  by the envelope check, which needed a contract carrying theory-derived bounds and a
  second engine to compare against. The stderr line is now evidence on its own, and
  needs neither. **`render` refuses on the same evidence** (#307): the guard is asked
  before the first view is drawn, so a hollowed part yields `origin: null` and exit `4`
  rather than four pictures of a part the source does not describe. Alongside that:
  `PARTSPEC_OPENSCAD` pins the binary; the version is recorded in every report because it
  changes the artifact; bounds derived from theory, not measured off the part (see
  `docs/SPEC-contract.md` §10 on reference-derived limits).

## 2. The default backend emits a broken mesh and certifies it valid **[corpus]**

- **Symptom.** A 2,212-star Gridfinity library, rendered with current OpenSCAD's
  **default** Manifold backend, produces a mesh with **4 non-manifold edges** (each
  shared by four faces — two shells touching along the z = 19.8 plane; genus 8 where the
  clean render is genus 0).
- **Root cause.** Backend-specific tessellation of coincident geometry. The same source
  under CGAL renders clean — the defect is the *render*, not the design.
- **Detected by.** A differential run varying only the backend; the face-per-edge count
  is arithmetic, not a heuristic, and `manifold3d` independently agrees. (F10)
- **When it's green.** OpenSCAD prints `Status: NoError`, `"simple": true`, **manifold**
  — and exits 0. Every one of those statements is false. This confirmed D13 —
  partspec never parses `--summary` — harder than the case D13 was built on: not an
  omitted validity key but a false one, asserted on a real part.
- **Guards.** `openscad(..., backend="CGAL")` selects the backend and
  `engine.render_backend` records it; `watertight` names boundary vs non-manifold edges;
  D17 preconditions make `volume`/`genus` refuse on the broken mesh instead of
  answering.

## 3. A hole that reaches the boundary stops being a hole **[corpus; essence [repo]]**

- **Symptom.** Lengthening a NEMA 17 plate's belt-tension slots from 6 mm to 8 mm —
  exactly the parameter someone bumps between revisions — makes the plate **unable to
  hold a motor**: the slots breach the plate edge and become open notches.
- **Root cause.** A hole is a topological property. When it opens onto the boundary the
  genus falls (5 → 1); nothing about "a slot got longer" warns that a threshold was
  crossed. Pushed further, one parameter swept across six values yields four regimes, the first
  three all exiting 0:
  correct (genus 5), unmountable (genus 1), pinched to non-manifold (refused, named),
  and shattered into six solids (`solid_count` answers 6 while `genus` declines,
  per-body).
- **Detected by.** `genus 5` — the only check of five that moved. (F15)
- **When it's green.** Renders, exits 0, watertight, one solid, exactly 42 × 42 × 4 —
  four of five checks identical to the good part. **Visual review is worst here**:
  open-ended slots look like a deliberate design choice.
- **Guards.** Assert topology (`genus`, `solid_count`), not just size; the mesh tier
  answers both with no feature recognition. The essence is reproduced in-repo:
  `tests/test_docs.py` sweeps a slot across a plate edge and watches `genus` drop while
  envelope, watertightness and solid count hold still.

## 4. A clearance allowance baked into a constant named for a nominal dimension **[repo]**

- **Symptom.** `bearings.scad` declares `od_608 = 22.5` — but a 608 bearing is Ø22.0
  (ISO 15), held to 0/−0.008 by ISO 492. Any model using `bearing(608)` *as the bearing*
  gets a phantom part 0.5 mm oversize; the bore carries its own undeclared +0.4.
- **Root cause.** A print-fit allowance for a *pocket* was written into the constant
  named for the *part*, with no comment. The width gives it away: exactly nominal — the
  allowance was applied where somebody was thinking about fit and omitted where they
  were not. The same shape recurs one library over: `NEMA17.scad`'s header says
  `42.67mm square plate` and ten lines later declares `l_NEMA17 = 42`. **Two authors,
  same slip — a property of the corpus, not a person.**
- **Detected by.** A contract carrying ISO 15's numbers with a generous ±0.1 band:
  `envelope` and `volume` both FAIL, bracketing the divergence between them. (F16; the
  in-repo reproduction is the Ø22.5-seat test in `tests/test_provenance.py`, and
  `partspec.refs.iso15` exists so the standard's numbers arrive cited instead of
  retyped.)
- **When it's green.** Nothing in the corpus checks anything, so the 22.5 mm "608" passes
  every render, forever, and every model built on it inherits the half-millimetre.
- **Guards.** Take limits from `partspec.refs` or the drawing — never from the model's
  own constants (the circular-contract disclosure, SPEC-contract §6/§10).

## 5. A parameter that binds nothing is accepted and dropped **[repo]**

- **Symptom.** Four contracts passed `style_lip=0` to a Gridfinity entry point that does
  not declare that variable (it lives in a sibling file). OpenSCAD silently discards a
  `-D` naming no top-level variable — so every run built a bin **with** the lip, while
  the report listed `style_lip: 0` under `params`, positively asserting a value the
  geometry never saw. Two of the four runs were green.
- **Root cause.** `-D` is an unchecked write into the interpreter's namespace; a typo'd
  or misrouted name reaches nothing and nobody says so.
- **Detected by.** partspec's unbound-parameter guard (#9), on its first run against the
  corpus — the first finding produced by a guard rather than a human. (F18)
- **When it's green.** Exit 0, clean mesh, and an artifact describing a part that was
  not built — the same shape as entries 1 and 2: **the tool chain is unanimous and
  wrong**.
- **Guards.** A `-D` matching no top-level variable fails the build, naming the variable
  and listing the ones that exist. Where an include did not open, the refusal still
  fires — withholding it traded this false error for a *silent false pass* — but it says
  the list is incomplete and names the file it could not read, and the fault is
  `environment` rather than the contract's, because an include that will not open says
  nothing about the part (#287).

## 6. Shared claims that assert the first implementation you looked at **[corpus]**

- **Symptom.** A claims file shared by two Gridfinity implementations asserted
  `genus(0)` — "an open tray has no through-holes". True of the CadQuery
  implementation; false of the OpenSCAD one, which enables refined base holes by
  default (genus 8 on a 2×1 bin).
- **Root cause.** The claim encoded an *implementation choice* the Gridfinity standard
  does not fix. Written while looking at one implementation, it silently became a claim
  about all of them.
- **Detected by.** The differential run: one contract, two engines, a FAIL that was the
  contract's fault. (F12)
- **When it's green.** With only one implementation in the loop, the over-tight claim
  passes indefinitely — and rejects every conforming alternative the day one appears.
- **Guards.** In shared claims, assert **only what the specification fixes**. The
  standard's numbers (42n − 0.5 pitch) agreed across engines to the micrometre;
  everything else is per-implementation.

## 7. The engine ecosystem breaks at install time, silently **[repo]**

- **Symptom.** After adding OCCT extras, `import cadquery` dies:
  `ImportError: cannot import name 'IVtkOCC_Shape'`. Later, *uninstalling* the culprit
  deleted co-owned files and broke build123d too.
- **Root cause.** `cadquery-ocp` and `cadquery-ocp-novtk` both install the same
  top-level `OCP/` package (326 vs 322 files); neither pip nor uv detects the conflict;
  whichever lands last wins. A fresh-venv spike that worked was resolution-order luck.
- **Detected by.** The first `import cadquery` after `uv sync --all-extras` — days can
  pass between the install exiting 0 and the import that reveals it, and the traceback
  blames the library, not the resolver. (F5. The sibling hazard is #109: the override below
  is *configuration*, and `uv pip` applies it to anything installed from this directory — so
  it silently reshapes installs it was never meant to touch, including published wheels.)
- **When it's green.** The install exits 0. The breakage surfaces only at first import,
  possibly days later, and looks like the *library's* bug.
- **Guards.** `[tool.uv] override-dependencies` drops novtk from resolution;
  `just ocp-guard` asserts exactly one provider; `_engine_import_error` names the
  two-provider state instead of relaying the raw ImportError.

## 8. Community CAD code is scripts and pinned libraries, not callables **[corpus]**

- **Symptom.** A 96-star community build123d library fails to import on build123d
  0.11.1 (`ShapePredicate` no longer exists); the flagship library's 66 examples are
  module-level scripts ending in `show(...)`, not parameterised functions. Most OpenSCAD
  is the same.
- **Root cause.** Community models are written against the engine version of their
  moment and for interactive use. Nothing about the ecosystem pushes toward
  `factory(**params) -> shape`.
- **Detected by.** Attempting to drive the corpus through `method(**params)`. (F8)
- **When it's green.** It isn't subtle — but the *cost* is: every real contract on
  community code ships a three-line adapter, and an agent that doesn't know this
  pattern will rewrite the model instead.
- **Guards.** partspec deliberately does not guess calling conventions; the adapter
  friction is recorded in `docs/PLAN.md`'s P4 revision note (citing F8): a real
  contract on community code usually ships a small explicit adapter.

## 9. A true diagnostic about a source whose mesh is exactly right **[repo]**

*Not from the dogfood corpus: found in review of PRs #329 and #357, and filed as #336 and
#333. It is here because it is a property of the language an authoring agent has to have
seen, and because it is the one entry whose green face is a **false red**.*

Two cases, one shape. In both, OpenSCAD prints a warning that is **true about the source**
and says nothing at all about whether the exported mesh is wrong — and partspec refuses on
it, because stderr does not carry the difference. Refusing is the deliberate choice; the
cost is written down here rather than paid quietly.

### 9a. A fault inside `%` background geometry

- **Symptom.** `partspec check` reports `ERROR: 3 skipped` at exit `4` over a part whose
  exported STL is **byte-identical** to the correct one. The quoted evidence names a
  module and a value, and the mesh it is supposedly about does not contain that module's
  output at all.
- **Root cause.** `%` marks a subtree as *background*: OpenSCAD **evaluates** it, shows it
  in the preview, and excludes it from the render and the export. Diagnostics from inside
  it still reach stderr, and stderr does not carry the modifier — the line names the file
  and the line number and nothing else — so a warning about scaffolding is
  indistinguishable, at the point partspec reads it, from a warning about the part.
  Measured on both pinned engines, `cube([40,30,6]);` followed by
  `%translate([undef,0,0]) cube(2);` prints
  `WARNING: Unable to convert translate([undef, 0, 0]) parameter to a vec3 or vec2 of
  numbers`, exports 684 bytes, and `cmp -s` says those bytes are the same 684 the source
  without the `%` line produces.
  The three modifiers differ, and only one of them has this property: `*` (disable) is
  never evaluated, so it emits nothing and costs nothing; `#` (highlight) **is** exported,
  so its warnings are about the mesh; `%` alone is evaluated and not exported.
- **Detected by.** The engine's own stderr on the path that succeeded — the same guard as
  entries 1 and 5 (`SPEC-report.md` §6.1). Nothing here needed a contract carrying theory.
- **When it's green.** It isn't, and that is the entry: this is the one shape in this
  catalogue where partspec refuses **more** than the geometry requires. **The refusal
  stands, deliberately** (#336). An `undef` inside a `%` subtree is a bug in the source
  whatever it costs today; the modifier is one character, so the scaffolding routinely
  becomes the part; and the alternative — correlating stderr's line numbers against the
  `%` nodes in a `.csg` export — buys silence on a real defect at the price of a second
  parser between the engine and the verdict. What was wrong was that the trade was
  **silent**: an agent hitting exit 4 on a byte-perfect mesh had no way to reach this
  conclusion from the report.
- **Guards.** `AGENT-CONTRACT.md` §2.3 now says it, at the bullet that routes a
  conversion error: if the quoted line's file and line land on a `%` subtree, the mesh is
  probably right and the source is still wrong. The remedy is unchanged — fix the `undef`,
  or delete the scaffolding. When debug geometry must stay and must cost nothing, `*` is
  the modifier that is free.

### 9b. A `rotate()` parameter the engine ignored

- **Symptom.** The same `ERROR: 3 skipped` at exit `4`, over a part that is rotated
  exactly as the source asked. The report says the engine "could not convert a value and
  built a default in place of it", and for this shape **no default went in**.
- **Root cause.** `Problem converting rotate(...)` means the engine could not use the
  `rotate` parameters *as written*. That is four different situations, and only some of
  them damage the mesh. Measured on both pinned engines, every byte comparison `cmp -s`
  against the correct source named:

  | source | what the mesh is | vs. correct |
  |---|---|---|
  | `rotate(o) cube(5)`, `o = undef` | identity — the rotation is **lost** | wrong part |
  | `rotate([o,0,0]) cube(5)` | identity — the rotation is **lost** | wrong part |
  | `rotate() cube([10,5,2])` | identity, which is what a no-op rotate is for | **byte-identical** to `cube([10,5,2])` |
  | `rotate([90,0,0,0]) cube([10,5,2])` | rotated 90° about X, as asked | **byte-identical** to `rotate([90,0,0]) …` |
  | `rotate(a=45, v="z") cube(5)` | rotated 45° about Z — the default axis, which is the one the author named | **byte-identical** to `rotate(a=45, v=[0,0,1]) …` |

  The fourth row is the one to understand: OpenSCAD 2021.01's own `transform.cc` reads
  `default: ok &= false; /* fallthrough */ case 3:`, so an over-long `a` vector still has
  its first three components read and applied. Only the "could I use this?" flag goes
  false. **Nothing is substituted at all**, and the warning is purely "your vector had a
  fourth element".
- **Detected by.** The engine's own stderr on the path that succeeded (#333), the same
  guard as 9a.
- **When it's green.** Three of the five rows above are byte-perfect and refused. `main`
  passes all five at exit 0; this guard errors **all five** at exit 4 (a sixth shape,
  silent on both engines, is below).
- **Guards.** The refusal stands. An over-long rotate vector, a string where an axis
  belongs, and an angle that never arrived are all bugs in the source; the marker cannot
  tell which of the four situations it is in, and the two that *do* damage the mesh are
  exactly the ones #333 exists to catch. `AGENT-CONTRACT.md` §2.3 tells the reader what
  the line does not say, so a byte-perfect mesh at exit 4 is diagnosable rather than
  baffling.
- **Not narrated at all**, and therefore not caught: `rotate(a=90, v=undef)` is silent on
  both engines and exits `0`. `undef` is not "defined", so the engine reads it as "no axis
  given" and applies its default — the part is rotated 90° about Z, byte-identical to
  `rotate(90)`. **It is not unrotated.** Same class as entry 5's silent shapes; tracked in
  #332, which is about the dimensions nothing narrates.

---

## The shared moral

Five of these nine (1, 2, 3, 5, and the header half of 4) have the same signature:
**exit 0, a clean watertight mesh, and an artifact that is not the part you asked for.**
Nothing in the render pipeline is positioned to notice, because every stage's contract
with the next is "produce *a* mesh", not "produce *the* mesh". The checks that caught
them — envelope from theory, topology, external standards, unbound-parameter refusal —
are all statements about **intent the model does not contain**, which is the reason this
tool exists and the reason a contract derived from the model's own numbers proves
nothing (entry 4).

Entry 9 is the inverse, and it is here so the ledger has both columns: a guard sharp
enough to catch the other eight refuses a byte-perfect mesh when the fault it can see is
in geometry that was never exported (9a), or in a parameter the engine ignored on its way
to building the part correctly (9b). That cost is written down rather than paid quietly —
the alternative to naming it is a reader who concludes the tool is unreliable, which is
the more expensive mistake.

*Cross-references from the authoring skills (#22, #23) land with those skills; each
entry above carries a stable heading for them to anchor to.*
