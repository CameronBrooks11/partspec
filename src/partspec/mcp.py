"""MCP server over the same primitives as the CLI.

D5 deferred this until the report was machine-readable and the CLI had real
use; D18 fixes what it may be: **stateless verbs over `check` and `measure`**.
Every call is a fresh evaluation of a contract against a source on disk,
returning the same artifact the CLI writes. No tool holds geometry between
calls — the interactive authoring session belongs to authoring tools.

Each call runs the CLI in a subprocess rather than calling into the runner
in-process, for two reasons that are load-bearing, not stylistic:

- `POST-V0.md` §8: `sys.modules` caches a model's helper modules, so a
  long-lived process that re-checks an edited model can build the *previous*
  version of a helper while digesting the new one from disk — a stale build
  reported as fresh. A process per call makes that impossible; #27 owns
  deciding whether an invalidation story is worth the startup cost it saves.
- The exit code is part of the contract (`SPEC-report.md`). A subprocess
  returns the CLI's own, unlaundered; an in-process call would re-derive it.

The `mcp` dependency is an extra, imported lazily inside `build_server` —
`import partspec` stays stdlib-only, and this module is imported only by the
`partspec-mcp` entry point and its tests.
