CLI first, MCP later (D5) — and the reason matters: the real contract is the
report schema plus the exit code, not the verbs. If `check` printed prose for
humans, an MCP layer would become a parser and the tool would be built twice.
With machine-readable output first, MCP is a thin adapter and `diff`, CI
annotations and a scorecard all fall out of the same artifact.

argparse rather than a CLI framework: a handful of subcommands does not justify a

def _print_contract_traceback(exc: BaseException) -> None:

    own frames dropped (#188).

    The traceback stays because a contract is arbitrary Python: for a `TypeError`
    in user code it is the only thing that says *where*. What the reader did not
    ask for is partspec's call path to that line — six internal frames around one
    useful one, and for a `ContractError` (deliberately raised, with a message
    written for the reader) the internals are never the answer.

    Frames from a third-party library the contract called are kept: they are not
    partspec explaining itself, and a CadQuery operation that raised four calls
    deep is genuinely where the failure happened.

    What survives is printed *contiguously*, so every gap carries a
    `[N frames hidden]` marker. Without it the reprint reads as a direct call
    chain that never happened, and the reader most likely to be misled is an
    agent parsing it.

    Four cases print the whole thing unfiltered, because a filter that hides a
    partspec bug is the silence this tool exists to refuse:

    - **No contract frames at all** — the exception came from inside partspec
      before user code ran, so its frames are all there is.
    - **A partspec frame at or below the contract's own** and the exception is
      not partspec's — partspec code participated in the failure rather than
      merely reaching the contract, so an `AttributeError` from `region.py` is
      a partspec bug and its frames are the bug report. The leading frames that
      only got the process to the contract (`cli`, `target`) do not count: they
      are on every stack and are what #188 is about. A `ContractError` from the
      same position is a diagnosis written for the reader, and its frames are
      noise — the exception's own module is what separates the two.
    - **An exception group** — `format_exception_only` renders a group as its
      header alone ("2 sub-exceptions"), losing every sub-exception *and* the
      contract frames inside them, which is the opposite of the point.
    - **A chained exception** (`raise ... from`, or one raised while handling
      another) — the other segments of the chain are information.

    The chain case is a real limitation, not a rounding error: a contract doing
    `try/except → raise ContractError(...)` is idiomatic, and implicit
    `__context__` chaining sends it here. Filtering each segment independently
    was considered and refused for v1 — walking the chain means reproducing
    CPython's connector prose and its group tree by hand, and a filter that
    prints a *misleading* chain is worse than one that prints a noisy true one.

    Presentation only: the exit code (`EXIT_ERROR`), the "the contract is wrong,
    not the part" classification and the report on disk are untouched. Nothing
    is filtered out of an artifact — this path's report is `write_placeholder`'s,
    and the diagnosis lives on stderr alone (`AGENT-CONTRACT.md` §2.3), which is
    the only reason its shape is worth this much care.

    not describe one of them differently from `check` (#308). What is local to

    """Build so the artifact lands at exactly `dest`, and only if it exists.

    **Nothing touches `dest` until there is an artifact to put there.** The
    engine runs in a scratch directory and the result is moved into place with
    `os.replace`, so the destination holds the old file or the new one and
    never neither: a failed build, a blown timeout or a Ctrl-C leaves whatever
    was there before, untouched.

    An earlier revision unlinked `dest` up front, reasoning that
    `openscad.render` does the same to its target so "a failed render leaves
    nothing behind for a later reader to pick up". That was wrong twice.
    `notes/FINDINGS.md` W9 states the remedy as an either/or — unlink the
    target *or* render to a fresh temp path and move it into place — and this
    function is the second branch, which is also the one FINDINGS praises
    `report.py` for. And the staleness W9 describes cannot arise here at all:
    the build happens in a fresh empty directory and the measurement is loaded
    from there, so `dest` is write-only for the whole run. What the unlink did
    reach was the caller's data. `.stl` is an *input* extension as well as an
    output one — SPEC-report §8.3 calls `import()`/`surface()` targets files
    that "genuinely are build inputs" — so deleting `dest` before the engine
    ran made a model importing it build without its import and report a
    confident, complete, wrong answer at exit 0. That is the defect #187
    exists to abolish, reintroduced by its own fix. `_measure_resolved`
    refuses a file destination for a model whose includes did not resolve, and
    this function refuses one the render is then found to have read (#263);
    neither removes anything it did not create.

    **The build happens in a scratch directory beside `dest`.** The engine
    names its export after the source file, so building straight into
    `dest.parent` would export `<source-stem>.stl` there first and unlink
    whatever the caller already had under that name — `--out models/a.stl`
    would destroy `models/spacer.stl`. Beside, rather than in the system temp
    dir, so the move into place is a rename on one filesystem. A symlink at
    `dest` is replaced by that rename rather than written through, so its
    target is untouched.

    The scratch directory is removed on every exit from this function,
    including exceptions and SIGINT; an uncaught signal — SIGTERM, SIGKILL —
    leaves a `.partspec-build-*` behind. Sweeping older ones is deliberately
    not done here: a concurrent `measure` writing another file in the same
    directory owns one of them, and this function cannot tell which.

    """Say, before the first build, that this invocation cannot cover its pin.

    The authoritative check is after the loop and stays there. This one exists
    because the answer is knowable at the start and was being delivered at the
    end: a `check a b c --expect lock.json` whose lock also covers a deleted
    `d` builds every surviving target first — 56 to 108 s each on the OCCT tier
    — and only then says the invocation could never have covered its pin. A
    human who is told at second one can abort; the exit code, the reports and
    the verdict are unchanged for one who does not (#202).

    **Coverage needs the RESOLVED set, and resolution is engine-free**, which
    is the whole reason this is affordable: a mismatch run measures 0.095 s
    against a build measured in minutes. What it costs is running the contract
    factory twice, and `SPEC-contract.md` nowhere requires a factory to be
    pure — so this takes nothing from the second resolve, holds no `Part`, and
    lets the loop's own resolve be the one that counts.

    **Silent whenever anything is uncertain.** A target that fails to resolve
    here is not reported here: the post-loop check knows how to weigh a
    failure against a missing part (#201, #243) and this does not, so any
    failure abandons the preview entirely rather than guessing. Which also
    means this cannot contradict the authoritative answer — it declines
    instead.

    **Silent under `--quiet`**, which the authoritative check is not. The whole
    purpose here is "you can stop this now", and that is meaningless to a
    non-interactive caller; the failure itself still reaches CI, once, from the
    place that owns the exit code. Doubling a diagnosis nobody can act on is
    noise, and noise on stderr is how a real one gets missed.

    Model modules are evicted between resolutions, because a contract's
    sibling import cached from one target must not answer for the next
    (#114, #101). That is the same sequence `_check_one` already uses.
