"""The geometry backend protocol.

The finding this design rests on (investigations/03): cad-khana's build123d
coupling is *pervasive by type but shallow by behaviour* — twelve geometry
primitives carry its entire diagnostic vocabulary, and most of the valuable logic
is already engine-independent. So engine neutrality is not a rewrite; it is a
protocol over a dozen methods plus value types of our own.

Two backends, not three (D3). One OCCT backend serves build123d *and* CadQuery
via a `.wrapped` adopt shim at the front door — verified: both expose a
`TopoDS_Shape` from the same OCP module, and `bd.Solid(cq_shape.wrapped)` adopts
losslessly. The only genuinely separate backend is mesh, for OpenSCAD.
