"""Where the documents this copy carries actually are.

Every diagnostic cites a spec by section ("SPEC-report.md 7.1"), and
`AGENT-CONTRACT.md` opens by routing the reader to
`skills/contract-authoring/SKILL.md`. Both are repo-relative, and until #349
neither resolved for anyone who installed rather than cloned: the wheel was the
package and nothing else. Measured against an installed 0.7.6, not inferred
from the build config --

    $ find ~/.local/share/uv/tools/partspec -name 'AGENT-CONTRACT.md'
    $                                        # nothing

-- so the whole agent-facing corpus was reachable only over the network, which
an agent without it cannot do at all.

The wheel now force-includes `docs/` and `skills/` under `_bundled/`, and that
directory is deliberately shaped like the repository root rather than like a
docs folder: a citation reads `docs/SPEC-contract.md` or
`skills/contract-authoring/SKILL.md`, and both resolve verbatim against what
`docs_root()` returns, in an install and in a checkout alike. No citation gets
rewritten for the install, and there is no second spelling of a path to keep in
sync with the first.

Nothing here searches. There are two candidate roots, each confirmed by opening
the entry points rather than by finding a directory of the right name, and
`None` when neither answers. A locator that guessed would be this project's own
thesis failing one level up: `cd "$(partspec --docs)"` must not land somewhere
plausible.
