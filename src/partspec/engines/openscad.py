"""Render an OpenSCAD source to a mesh.

Deliberately does not parse `--summary` (D13). That flag omits volume and area
entirely, its `facets` field means different things depending on the render
backend, and — the reason it is banned rather than merely unhelpful — on invalid
geometry it emits JSON with the validity key *absent* while exiting 0. A checker
doing `.get("simple", True)` therefore passes a broken part silently. Export the
mesh and measure that instead; trimesh catches the same case immediately.

Ignoring `--summary` has a second benefit: it removes any reason to care whether
the installed OpenSCAD is the 2021.01 stable or a current nightly, so no nightly
install is a prerequisite.

    """Refuse, before rendering, when the artifact would land on a file that
    may be an input and nothing later can say whether it is.

    Building in a scratch directory keeps the MEASUREMENT honest — the engine
    reads whatever inputs are on disk, because nothing has been removed — but
    the move into place still writes `<stem>.stl` over whatever holds that
    name, and where the model reads that file the NEXT run measures something
    else. #208's repro is exactly that: `part.scad` imports `part.stl`, a
    destination of the source's own directory derives `part.stl`, and after
    the run the input is the output. Under `check` it was worse than a wrong
    number — a PASS verdict on geometry that was not the part.

    **This guard used to carry that case and no longer does.** An
    `import()`/`surface()` target is named in the engine's own dependency
    output, so #263 moved the question to `_wrote_over_an_input`, which is
    asked after the render and answers exactly which files were read. What is
    left here is the arm no depfile can reach: an **unresolved include**, which
    is listed nowhere at all because the depfile names what was opened and
    never what was asked for. partspec cannot see inside a file it could not
    find, so it cannot know whether that file imports data either — and no
    later signal will tell it. The narrowest condition is all three of:

    1. the destination is the directory the source's relative
       `import()`/`surface()` paths resolve against — its own;
    2. `<stem>.stl` is already there to be destroyed;
    3. an include did not resolve, so inputs exist that partspec cannot
       enumerate and the engine will not enumerate for it.

    (1) and (2) together are `would_overwrite`, which the caller computes
    before anything is written and hands to both guards — the post-render one
    falls back on exactly this condition when the engine cannot name its
    inputs, and by the time it runs, this call has created the file it would
    be asking about.

    Each clause is load-bearing in the direction of NOT over-refusing. Without
    (1) the second run of any such model against the default `outputs/<part-slug>`
    finds run 1's own artifact there and is refused — the ordinary path,
    broken. Without (2) a first run into the source directory is refused over a
    file that does not exist. Without (3) any model rendering twice into its
    own directory is refused on the second run.

    **What clause (1) used to cost, and no longer does.** Scoped this way, the
    old guard under-refused, and the cost was not one file. Where the import
    sat in a subdirectory — `import("sub/part.stl")` with `--out sub` — the
    artifact was REPLACED at that path rather than deleted, so the import still
    resolved and the model ate its own output. Measured then, three identical
    consecutive runs against a 3x7x11 donor:

        run 1  exit 0  bbox [8, 7, 11]   (correct)
        run 2  exit 0  bbox [13, 7, 11]
        run 3  exit 0  bbox [18, 7, 11]

    and `check` with a claim that is FALSE of the real part — `envelope(min=(12,
    7, 11))` — failed at run 1 and **passed at run 2**. So the residue was an
    unbounded series of confident wrong answers — at exit 0 for `measure`, and
    for `check` a verdict computed on geometry that is not the part, whichever
    way the claim points. That is #208's own headline symptom surviving in a
    narrower case, and it is what the post-render guard exists to end: the
    subdirectory import is in the dependency list by full resolved path, so the
    replace is refused wherever the destination sits.

    Scanning the closure for the destination's NAME was the precise alternative
    considered and rejected at the time: it resolves nothing when the path is
    computed, which is the case `reads_external_data` exists to admit, so it
    would refuse in the easy case and stay silent in the hard one. The remedy
    was always a signal that says which files a render actually READ, and that
    signal now exists.

    asked only of a model whose closure is PARTIAL — for one that is not, every
    file the engine can reach is a `.scad` partspec has already walked, and the
    destination is an `.stl` no part of it names.

    Partial rather than `reads_external_data`, because the unresolved arm is
    not merely a case the depfile happens to cover as well. An `include` that
    partspec cannot find on ITS search path may resolve on the engine's, and
    the file behind it may hold the `import()` partspec then never saw — so a
    closure reporting `reads_external_data: False` is not a promise that the
    render read no data. It is the depfile, not the regex, that knows.

    **Nothing has been replaced yet**, which is what makes a late refusal
    correct rather than merely tidy: both movers stage into a scratch directory
    and this runs before the rename, so the caller's file is exactly as it was.
    What it costs is a render, and the message says so — the caller could not
    have known, and an error implying otherwise sends them looking for a
    mistake they did not make.

    **`refuse_unanswered` is what to say when the engine did not answer**, and
    it is not a preference: it is the caller keeping its own old behaviour for
    the case this cannot improve on. An engine with no `-d` writes no depfile,
    so `deps` is `absent` — which is not "the render read nothing"
    (`RenderDeps`) — and the exact question is unanswerable there exactly as it
    was before #226. So `render` passes the pre-render answer its conservative
    guard would have given (destination in the model's own directory, name
    already taken), and `cli._build_to_file` passes True, because a
    caller-named file destination was never provable and its refusal is the one
    #208 shipped. Neither loosens on an engine that cannot answer; both become
    exact on one that can.

    **A complete list that CONTRADICTS the source is not an answer either**, and
    this is F13 arriving in a guard. `import_stl()` is deprecated; 2021.01 still
    executes it and the 2026.08.01 snapshot ignores it — so for one source the
    depfile names the data file on one engine and omits it on the other, and
    taking the second at face value would hand back "safe to write" for a file
    the same contract reads on the machine next to it. Where the closure says
    the source reads external data and the render read none, the two disagree,
    and a disagreement is treated exactly as no answer at all: `refuse_unanswered`
    decides, so both callers keep the answer they gave before #263.

    It over-refuses by that clause alone — an `import()` inside a branch the
    render never took reads nothing legitimately — and that is the direction to
    err in, because the cost of the other one is the caller's data.

    `partial` is unreachable from both call sites — a failed render returns
    before either mover is reached — and refuses under the same flag if that

    built something other than what the source asked for **on a render that
    succeeded** (#286, #308): a name it could not resolve, or a value it could
    not convert and defaulted. OpenSCAD renders an unresolved call's children
    not at all, and substitutes a default where a dimension would not convert,
    and still exits 0 with a well-formed mesh in both cases -- so the artifact
    alone cannot say that the geometry measured is not the geometry the source
    describes, and this return type has no room to say it. Before #286 those
    lines were read only to build a `BuildError`, which is to say only when the
    engine had already failed; the success path discarded `proc.stderr`
    outright and every downstream check reported PASS against a part the engine
    had quietly hollowed out.

    Binary STL specifically: lib3mf cannot read ASCII STL, and OpenSCAD 2021.01
    defaults to ASCII. Choosing the format explicitly means the export does not
    silently change meaning with the installed version.

    **No file this call did not create is touched until there is an artifact to
    put there.** The engine writes into a scratch directory under `out_dir` and
    the result is moved into place with `os.replace`, so the destination holds
    the old file or the new one and never neither. It is the shape
    `cli._build_to_file` settled on for the filename form of `--out` — the
    directory form never got it (#208) — and the one SPEC-backend §5 step 1
    already spells the invocation with (`-o <tmp>.stl`), though the spec is
    illustrating the command rather than requiring the temporary.

    The claim is scoped that way rather than to "nothing in `out_dir`" because
    the scratch directory itself IS created there, before the engine runs. It
    is removed on every exit from the `with`, including exceptions and SIGINT;
    an uncaught signal — SIGTERM, SIGKILL — leaves a `.partspec-build-*`
    behind (measured: exit 143, leftover confirmed). Sweeping older ones is
    deliberately not done here, for `_build_to_file`'s reason: a concurrent
    render in the same directory owns one of them, and this call cannot tell
    which. A symlink at the destination is replaced by the rename rather than
    written through, so its target is untouched.

    An earlier revision unlinked the target up front, so that the
    exists/non-empty guards below could not be answered by a *stale* file from
    a previous run. That reason does not survive the scratch directory: the
    guards now ask about a file in a directory this call created empty
    moments earlier, so no previous run's mesh can be standing in it and there
    is nothing stale to be fooled by. What the unlink did reach was the
    caller's data — `.stl` is an input extension as well as an output one, and
    a model importing `<stem>.stl` built without its import and reported a
    complete, confident, wrong answer at exit 0, `measure` and `check` alike.

    `timeout_s` here is already resolved: a number is the bound, None is
    unbounded (the explicit `--timeout 0` waiver). The None-means-default rule

    every parameter binding exactly as the canonical views saw it — no second

    `<stem>.section.stl` nor the `<stem>.section.scad` that produces it is a

"""The diagnostics that name a NAME the engine could not resolve.

Separated from `_UNRESOLVED_MARKERS` because the two sets answer different
questions and only one of them is safe to ask of a render that SUCCEEDED.
Each says a name was looked up and not found; what follows from that differs
by kind. A module or include is direct -- OpenSCAD renders that call's children
not at all, so geometry the source asked for is simply gone. A function or
variable yields `undef` into an expression instead, which may or may not reach
geometry: `echo(nofunc(3))` beside a correct cube is refused on this evidence
even though the cube is right. That is deliberate. stderr cannot say whether
the `undef` reached a dimension, the diagnosis (a name did not resolve) is true
either way, and the remedy is the same -- while a value silently substituted
into a dimension is the case that must not be waved through (#286).

A second success-path shape lives in `_SUBSTITUTED_VALUE_MARKERS` below rather
than here, because the diagnosis differs: no name failed to resolve, a value
failed to CONVERT and the engine put a default in its place. Both sets are read
after a render that succeeded, together, as `_SUCCESS_PATH_MARKERS` (#308).

`undefined operation` is deliberately NOT here. It reports a type error in an
expression, not a lookup that failed, and on the success path it fires on code
whose geometry is completely correct: `echo("holes: " + holes)` -- `+` where
`str()` was meant, and among the most common things in a real .scad -- renders
a perfect part and prints exactly that line. Guarding on it errored that part
at exit 4 while telling the reader a name had not resolved and to check
`OPENSCADPATH`, which was false in every clause. Caught in review of PR #306.

It remains in `_UNRESOLVED_MARKERS` below, where the question is narrower and
the docstring's reasoning holds: there, the render already produced NOTHING,
and `vector * string` is real evidence that a null result is not genuine."""

"""What OpenSCAD says where a value reached geometry and could not be converted,
so a default went in instead.

This is the discrimination `undefined operation` could not make. That line
reports a type error anywhere in the file, geometry or not, which is why
guarding on it errored correct parts (see above). `Unable to convert` is
emitted at the point of SUBSTITUTION, by the module whose parameter it is, and
names that module and the value it rejected. Measured on both engines, the
`echo("holes: " + holes)` case that killed the wider marker does not emit it --
nothing reached geometry there, so there was nothing to substitute into.

The substitution is total, not partial: `cube(size=[o, 30, 6])` with `o = undef`
exports a 1x1x1 unit cube on both engines -- the 30 and the 6 go with the axis
that did not convert -- watertight, single-solid, exit 0.

What this does NOT cover, measured rather than assumed, and the reason #308's
own headline reproduction is still open: a *scalar* dimension taking `undef`
prints nothing at all. `linear_extrude(undef) square([40,30])` and
`cylinder(h=undef)` are silent on both engines; `linear_extrude(undef + 1)`
prints `undefined operation` and no conversion line. There is no stderr signal
to guard on, so a fix needs another channel entirely -- #332 holds the
measurements.

Nor is "vector-valued" the rule, which an earlier draft of this docstring
asserted and round-1 review disproved. `resize([undef,10,10])`,
`multmatrix(undef)` and `offset(delta=undef)` are silent on BOTH engines while
building a defaulted part. Which modules narrate the substitution is the
engine's own list, not a property anyone can derive; the four above are the
ones measured, `mirror([undef,0,0])` is a fifth, and this set covers what the
engine chooses to say and nothing more. Do not read it as covering every
silently defaulted dimension.

`rotate(a=undef)` drops a rotation just as quietly and words it
`Problem converting rotate(a=undef) parameter` -- identical on both engines,
same class, deliberately not added here (#333).

"""Conversion warnings that are true and about nothing that is exported.

Two classes, and only the first is unconditionally irrelevant. A viewport
variable is the GUI camera and no exported mesh can depend on it. A range or
step is different, and the difference is a TRADE rather than a fact.

A failed range yields `undef` into the expression, exactly as an unresolved
function does -- and an unresolved function's `undef` IS refused, on the
reasoning `SPEC-report.md` §6.1 gives in as many words. What separates them is
only that this line fires on a correct part often enough to matter and that one
does not. So the honest statement is: **this line cannot distinguish an
expression that reached geometry from one that did not**, correct parts win the
tie, and there is a remainder.

The remainder is real and measured on 2026.08.01, where this line is the ONLY
stderr signal in each case:

    module rail(n = undef) {                    // the loop's geometry vanishes
      cube([40, 8, 6]);
      for (i = [1 : n]) translate([i*8, 0, 6]) cube([6, 8, 4]);
    }
    rail();                                     // `Facets: 6` against 76 for n=4

    n = undef;  r = [0 : n];  h = r[2];         // #308's own headline shape
    linear_extrude(h) square([40, 30]);         // exported bbox z 0..100

`Facets:` is OpenSCAD's own summary vocabulary, quoted rather than measured: the
exported STL carries 12 triangles for the defaulted part and 76 for `n = 4`, so
a reader cross-checking against `partspec measure` sees 12 where the engine says
6. The engine's number is the one printed beside the warning, which is why it is
the one shown; the mesh is what partspec measures (D15).

The second is `linear_extrude` substituting its own default into a dimension --
precisely the fault #308 exists to refuse -- passing at exit 0. Filed as #338.

Carved out anyway, and the precedent is settled: matching this line refused
CORRECT parts (round-2 review of PR #329 found the protected echo case from PR
#306 with a range where the string concat was -- byte-identical export, exit 4
on 2026.08.01 against exit 0 on 2021.01), and `undefined operation` came off
the success path for exactly this reason with #332 holding its remainder. A
loud false error on working code is the worse trade, and this repo has made it
twice and reverted twice.

Both entries are ANCHORED at the head of the engine's sentence, like the marker
itself -- see `_unresolved_lines`."""

that would not convert.

The list exists because an unresolved name and a genuinely null result are
INDISTINGUISHABLE downstream: both exit 1 with `Current top level object is
empty.` and write no STL. A model whose whole top-level object comes from a
failed include renders empty and, without these lines, reads exactly like a
clean pass — which is how `p.empty()` would launder a broken probe into a green
one. So the markers are the evidence, and they are all that separates the two.

    `markers` defaults to the wide set, which is right where the render already
    produced nothing. A caller asking about a render that SUCCEEDED must pass
    `_SUCCESS_PATH_MARKERS` -- see `_UNRESOLVED_NAME_MARKERS` for the one that
    does not survive the move.

    The non-geometry carve-out is applied to every set rather than folded into
    one, because it is a statement about the LINE and not about the caller: a
    `$vpt` or range conversion is read the same way whether the render
    succeeded or produced nothing.

    A substitution marker is matched ANCHORED at the head of the engine's
    sentence, through `is_substituted_value`, and the name markers by
    substring. Two measured reasons, both for the anchor.

    OpenSCAD echoes string literals verbatim into the warning, so an
    unanchored test let the source turn the guard off by naming the carve-out
    (round-1 review):

        translate(["harmless", o, 0]) cube(5);              -> refused, exit 4
        translate(["Unable to convert $vp", o, 0]) cube(5); -> PASSED, exit 0

    `The given mesh is not closed! Unable to convert to CGAL_Nef_Polyhedron.`

    STL, no value substituted anywhere -- while 2026.08.01 words the same
    failure `[manifold] Input mesh is not closed!` and never says "convert".
    Unanchored, one source got two different reports on the two pinned
    engines, and the 2021.01 one blamed a defaulted dimension for an unclosed
    mesh. That is F13 with a false cause attached, found sweeping 1503

    The STL is rendered first, deliberately: it carries the guards this path
    must not re-invent — unbound `-D` detection, the empty-geometry refusal —
    so a cut that consumed the part is a `BuildError` here, never four blank
    frames that *look* like a rendered part. It also supplies the bounding box
    the camera framing derives from. The images carry no verdict: rendering
    never substitutes for measurement.

    All four views are rendered into a scratch directory and moved into place
    together, the shape `render()` settled on (#208, #224). Here the hazard the
    old per-view unlink carried was not remote: `surface(file = "...")` reads a
    PNG as a heightmap on both engine versions, so `render --out .` against a
    model reading `renders/iso.png` deleted that heightmap before the engine
    ran, then rendered and reported the part built without it — measured, first
    run, clean directory, exit 0, nothing on stderr.

    A failure while RENDERING leaves the previous set of views untouched. A
    failure while MOVING cannot: there is no atomic rename of four files, so
    the one case that is knowable up front — a destination that is a directory
    — is refused before the first move, and a move that fails anyway reports
    how many were replaced instead of claiming nothing was.

    What survives is the residue `render()` also ships with, and it is not a
    lost file: the move still replaces whatever sits at the destination, so a
    model reading its own view directory renders correctly once and then reads
    its own output forever — but only when `--out` points at a directory
    CONTAINING the file the model reads. OpenSCAD resolves `surface(file = ...)`
    against the entry file's directory, so with `--out` genuinely elsewhere the
    written PNG never lands on the read one and consecutive runs are identical.
    This paragraph omitted that condition until the v0.7.6 pre-tag audit, which
    measured both shapes; the CHANGELOG had already been corrected and the
    docstring left behind, in the same commit.

    Measured on 2021.01 for the case that does compound — a model reading
    `sub/renders/iso.png`, rendered with `--out sub` — run 1 gives a correct
    `render_bbox`, and from run 2 the heightmap IS partspec's own view, so the
    part takes that image's extent: `IMAGE_SIZE` is 800x800 and `surface()`
    spans one unit per pixel gap, giving 799 in x and y, at exit 0 with nothing
    on stderr, on every run after.

    **That is the residue this function no longer ships.** #226 landed the
    signal, #263 applied it to the STL move, and #267 applies it here:
    `_wrote_over_an_input` refuses a destination the render actually read, on
    the engine's own dependency list rather than on a guess. No second `-d`
    pass is needed — a `surface()` target is opened when the source is parsed,
    so the STL pass's depfile already names the heightmap — and the guard is
    asked of every view **before any view moves**, which is the constraint the
    batched move below exists for.

    What survives is the case no depfile reaches: an engine with no `-d` writes
    nothing to ask, and there this path keeps the behaviour it had, which was
    no guard at all. A refusal nothing can justify would be worse than the
    residue.

    Shares `_first_error_line`'s NOISE FILTER — one list, kept in step by being
    one list — and then takes the first line, which is not what that function
    does. Reading `lines[0]` raw let the two disagree silently: the cache
    statistics both binaries print FIRST would push a rejection to line two,
    reverting the classification to `model` while the hint still named the
    option, which is the bug this branch fixes.

    But delegating to `_first_error_line` wholesale was worse, and briefly
    shipped on this branch: it prefers a line containing `ERROR`/`WARNING`
    ANYWHERE in stderr, so a 58-line usage dump came into scope. Today's
    2021.01 dump survives on letter case alone — it contains "errors)" and
    "Stop on the first warning", both lowercase — and an engine that
    capitalised either word would flip the origin back to `model` with nothing
    to show for it (PR #160 review, R2). A CLI-level rejection is printed
    before any compilation output, so the first signal line is the whole
    question and the dump is never in scope.

    Coupling the filter is the property, not immunity to noise. A line `_NOISE`
    does not know — a Mesa/libEGL warning on a headless box, say — still
    displaces the rejection, and displaces the hint with it, so the report stays
    self-consistent and `build_stderr` carries the whole text either way. The
    fix for such a line is to teach `_NOISE` about it once it is observed;
    guessing at the list here would be a second filter to keep in step.

    One line, not a window. Anything looser reads the `Usage:` dump that
    follows, which lists every allowed option and on some builds contains this
    very phrase: a three-line window classified `ERROR: Parser error` plus a
    usage dump as an engine fault, which is an ordinary compile failure blamed
    on the machine. Both directions are pinned by test.

    `include_closure`'s regex stays the only thing that knows an include was
    asked for. What this adds is the half no static reader can have: a

    computed at render time.

    - `partial` — the engine failed but wrote a depfile: what it had opened
      before it stopped, which is a floor and not the whole set.
    - `absent` — no depfile at all. Nothing may be concluded from it; in
      particular it is not "the render read nothing", which is what an empty
      `files` under any other state would mean.

      **Which failures land here is engine-version-dependent, so do not key on

      2021.01 answer as universal. What holds on both is the only thing worth
