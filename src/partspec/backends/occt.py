"""The OCCT backend: measures a BREP shape.

Serves **build123d and CadQuery from one implementation** (D3). Verified: both
expose a `TopoDS_Shape` from the same OCP module, and a CadQuery result is
adopted by rewrapping the handle — no conversion, no copy, no loss. There is no
second code path to keep in sync, which is why CadQuery costs an afternoon
rather than a parallel backend.

This is the tier where topology is real. `topology_counts` is answered here and
refused on mesh, and that asymmetry is the whole point of having tiers.

    collapses where real material can be shown along the span, keeping the

        A solid is bounded by one outer shell plus one shell per enclosed void,

        correctly — a block with a sealed cavity is 1 solid and 2 shells — and
        the quantity was simply never exposed. The mesh tier reaches the same
        two numbers from triangle orientation.

        Counted **per solid**, not as a global `shells - solids`. The global
        form assumes every shell belongs to a solid, and nothing enforces
        that: one plain block beside a stray sheet body is 1 solid and 2
        shells, so the difference certified `cavities = 1, exact` on a part
        with no cavity at all — `verdict: pass`, exit 0. An open shell alone
        was the same arithmetic with nothing to hide behind, 1 minus 0.

        PR #147's first attempt gated on `not a.solids()`, which caught only
        the second case; its own review produced the first through the CLI
        and the false pass was still there. Summing each solid's own shells
        minus its outer one needs no precondition for the solid-bearing
        cases, is 0 for every stray-shell arrangement, and agrees with the
        mesh tier — which the gate did not (OCCT refused where mesh answered
        0, so one contract still adjudicated two ways).

        `_empty` is still refused, as `bbox` and `watertight` refuse it: a

        first draft's impossibility claim: the MEASURAND is now declared
        precisely, the bound is sound within it, and its escapes are
        recorded rather than denied.

        **Measurand**: the minimum span between NON-ADJACENT boundary faces
        through material, plus the certified diametric spans of closed
        analytic faces. `lo` is the minimum over ALL non-adjacent pairs of
        the kernel-exact distance — gap-classified pairs are RETAINED (PR
        #144, F2: any wall between two faces is at least their pair
        distance, so keeping the gap value is always sound; excluding the
        pair once took a real wall with it), which makes a gap-limited claim
        adjudicate approximate rather than falsely tight. A closed face's
        diametric span is included unless an EXACT boolean (its axis edge or
        tube circle against the solid) certifies the enclosed line is
        entirely void (PR #144, F1: a single probe point once discarded a
        rod's diameter because it landed in a cross-hole).

        `hi` is the smallest measurand member this can point to. Either a
        witnessed crossing — an inward normal ray whose first exit lands on a
        non-adjacent face, or on the same closed face — or the diametric span
        of a closed analytic face shown material along a chord (issue #145,
        item 2: the chord reaches a frustum's narrow rim, which the ray grid
        misses, and answers a frustum whose every normal exits through an
        adjacent cap). A RAY crossing below lo is not clamped away — it is
        proof the analysis contradicts itself, and the check refuses (PR #144,
        F3: the old clamp silenced exactly that counter-evidence). A certified
        span cannot go below lo: it is one of the values lo minimised over.

        **Recorded escapes** (SPEC-contract.md 4.11): material bounded by
        edge-SHARING faces — the web beside a drilled hole, a boss root —
        is outside the measurand (the shared-edge span tends to zero at the
        rim, which is the same geometry as a wedge tip); so is a wall whose
        two sides are one open non-analytic face (a folded sheet modeled as
        a single spline face). Neither is measured, and the spec says so.

        from being counted as holes they are not. Coaxial groups of different
        radius stay distinct, so a counterbore reports one bore per diameter —
        each portion is a real seat with a real drawing callout. The axial-span
        clustering is what makes two aligned holes through two clevis lugs
        count as the two bores the drawing calls out, not one.

        Diameters are read from the BREP surface parameter, so they are exact:
        the predicted first exercise of `approximate` (POST-V0 §4) did not
        materialise, because a modelled cylinder's radius is a parameter, not
        an estimate.
