"""The mesh backend: measures a triangle mesh, which is what OpenSCAD emits.

Every quantity here is reported `exact`, and that is not a shortcut. Under D15 a
measurement describes *the artifact as authored and exported*, and a mesh **is** a
polyhedron — its volume, area, bounding box, watertightness, solid count and genus
are computed exactly from its triangles. There is no smooth ideal being
approximated, so there is no tessellation error to bound. Changing $fn does not
degrade a measurement; it produces a *different part*, which is a design change
the tool should report loudly rather than absorb into an error bar.

**Exactness is conditional on the mesh being what the measurement presumes.**
Volume and centre of mass are integrals over a closed, consistently-wound
surface; genus is the Euler characteristic of a closed one; a body count is
determined only where no edge is shared by more than two faces. Where a mesh
fails the precondition, the honest answer is `Unsupported` — returning a number
anyway is the second of the three failure modes this tool exists to prevent, and
it was doing exactly that until 2026-08-05 (dogfood F14).

The one genuine inexactness is float32 quantisation in binary STL (~1e-7
relative), which is narrower than the comparison epsilon and so carries no
information — see `SPEC-backend.md` 5.2 for why collapsing it is permitted here
and nowhere else.

          order to turn the check green (`evals/BASELINE.md`).
        * An *open* shell bounds no solid, so it is 0, not 1. The old count said
          1 where the OCCT tier says 0.

        Orientation is what separates the two: under the divergence theorem an
        outward-oriented closed component encloses positive volume and a cavity's
        inner shell, wound inward as seen from itself, encloses negative volume.

        Computed here rather than delegated, because both obvious delegates are

        triangles and moved the enclosed volume by 25.31 mm3, so its answer

        Refused where any edge is shared by more than two faces, because there
        the count is **not determined by the geometry**: counting through such a
