## Project

`partspec` verifies CAD-as-code parts against engineering intent declared in a Python
contract. It builds a part from an OpenSCAD, build123d or CadQuery source, checks it, and
emits a JSON report. Its one distinguishing property, from which most of the design
follows: **silence must never read as success** — a check the tool could not evaluate, or
could not evaluate precisely enough to decide, never reports as a pass.

Six verbs, three of which decide and exit on the outcome: `check` gives the part's
verdict; `diff` compares two reports and `vdiff` two runs' images, both over
`{identical: 0, different: 1, indeterminate: 2}` (SPEC-diff §2) — for them too, silence
must never read as "no difference". The other three answer without deciding: `measure`
dumps every quantity it can honestly produce, `render` writes the canonical views, and
`lint` reads the source advisorily, exiting 0 whatever it finds because the findings are
data about the source and not a verdict on the part.

Status: pre-alpha; **v0.7.8 on PyPI** (2026-09-03, tag → trusted publishing via
`release.yml`). What each release changed is in `CHANGELOG.md`; `docs/POST-V0.md` records
what is still withheld and why. Keep this section an orientation — a test bounds it, since
release narrative accreted here for six releases with nothing to evict it.

**Start here.** `docs/AGENT-CONTRACT.md` is how to drive the tool: which artifact to read,
what each exit code obliges you to do, and the two cases where the exit and the report
disagree on purpose. `docs/SPEC-contract.md` is how to author one.

## Stack

- **Python ≥3.12**, `uv` for dependency management, `hatchling` build backend
- **ruff** (format + lint), **pyright** (`standard`), **pytest**
- **Engines are optional extras**: `mesh` (trimesh + manifold3d), `occt` (build123d),
  `cadquery`. The `openscad` binary is a system dependency.

## Layout

The `src/` tree is generated from the package itself (`just fmt`), so a module cannot go
missing from it and a row cannot outlive what it describes — four had, and two did (#299).

`docs/` and `skills/` are the two trees that also ship **inside the wheel**, copied to
`partspec/_bundled/` at build time so an installed copy can read the corpus it cites;
`partspec --docs` prints that directory, and it mirrors the repository root so the
citations inside those files resolve unchanged (#349). Nothing in either tree may be
UNTRACKED — `force-include` copies what is on disk, not what git tracks, so a stray file
would ride into the wheel and make a dev build differ from a CI one. (Generated content is
fine, and already there: three specs carry `BEGIN GENERATED` blocks.)

## Commands

```sh
just setup           # uv sync --all-extras (ALL engines — matches CI exactly)
just fmt             # ruff format + ruff check --fix + regenerate doc blocks
just gen-docs        # regenerate the generated doc blocks alone
just check           # fmt-check + gen-docs --check + lint + typecheck (CI-equivalent)
just hooks           # every pre-commit hook over the whole tree (CI runs this too)
just test            # pytest
just test-reverse    # the suite in reverse file order — catches cross-test state leaks
just run -- --version
just setup-mesh      # light path: mesh tier only. NOT what CI runs
just test-mesh-only  # the WHOLE suite against a throwaway scipy-free [mesh] install (CI runs this)
just test-mcp-only   # MCP tests against a throwaway engine-free [mcp] install (CI runs this)
just test-no-extras  # the WHOLE suite against a no-extras install (CI runs this)
just ocp-guard       # assert exactly one OCP provider is installed
```

The two OCCT-tier environments take minutes, because OCCT is ~1.5GB. They went
unrun until 2026-08-11 because `uv pip install .[occt]` appeared to strand OCP
(#109) and the shape every other recipe used seemed unable to build them. It
was this repo's own `[tool.uv] override-dependencies`: **`uv pip` reads
`[tool.uv]` from the nearest pyproject.toml above the CWD and applies it to
whatever it is installing**, so any `uv pip install` run from this checkout
resolves against our overrides, published wheels included. Every recipe that
installs into a throwaway environment therefore passes `--no-config`, and
`tests/test_packaging.py` refuses one that does not. CI runs both, gated on the
`changes` path filter so a docs-only PR does not pay for them:

```sh
just test-occt-only      # the WHOLE suite against a throwaway [occt] install
just test-cadquery-only  # ditto [cadquery] — which lands TWO OCP providers, by design
```

The same trap applies to the release cold-verify: install the published wheel
from a directory outside the repo, or the thing you verify is not the thing
users get.

Those two CI jobs set `PARTSPEC_REQUIRE_ENGINES` to the engine the extra
promises, which is the only place in the gate that can tell *the extra
installed* from *the extra works*: `conftest.py` resolves it by importing,
while every `needs_*` marker keys on `find_spec` — and #109 is exactly the
state where the distribution is present and the import fails.

`PARTSPEC_OPENSCAD` pins the engine; `PARTSPEC_REQUIRE_ENGINES=1` turns a missing one from
a skip into a hard failure. CI sets both, across a **two-version matrix** — apt 2021.01 and
a pinned 2026.08.01 snapshot — because F13 is the finding that the same source builds a
different part on a different engine, and because `--backend` does not exist on 2021.01.
Run the suite under both before touching `engines/openscad.py`.

## Conventions

- **The specs in `docs/` are normative.** `SPEC-report.md`, `SPEC-contract.md` and
  `SPEC-backend.md` define behaviour; the code implements them. If code and spec disagree,
  that is a bug in one of them — say which, do not silently pick.
- **Mechanical enumerations inside the specs are GENERATED**, between
  `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: name -->` markers: the vocabulary tables, the unit table,
  `DIMENSIONAL_KINDS`, the backend protocol block, the README's exit codes, and the `src/`
  half of the Layout tree above. Edit the code
  and run `just fmt`; editing the block by hand is reverted on the next run and `just check`
  fails meanwhile. The prose around them is hand-written and stays normative — only the
  parts that are a projection of the code by definition are generated, because a generated
  spec could never say the code is wrong.
- **Do not write a test that reads a doc and reads the code and diffs them.** That is two
  copies of one fact with a failure report attached; generate the doc instead. Equally, do
  not assert that a phrase appears in prose — `assert "five defect classes in" in README`
  passes when the README says "five defect classes in 2019, all of which failed". A
  substring search reports that a string is present, which is not a claim anyone wanted to
  make. Seven such tests were deleted in #150. What belongs in `tests/test_docs.py` is a
  claim that can be **executed**: the skills' examples build, the README's example runs.
- **Decisions live in `docs/DECISIONS.md`** (D1–D19), each with the reasoning that produced
  it. Do not relitigate a numbered decision; if it is wrong, add a superseding entry.
- **Released `CHANGELOG.md` sections take form-only edits.** Rewriting a citation as a
  link, or fixing a reference that no longer resolves, is allowed and expected: the
  rendered claim is unchanged and a broken reference in a released section is a lie to
  every reader who arrives later. Changing what an entry *claims* is not — that goes in a
  new `[Unreleased]` entry correcting the old one, so "released sections are editable"
  never becomes the reading.
- **Status claims are part of the gate.** The "Status:" line here and in `README.md` say
  what does and does not work. Both were left asserting the backends were unimplemented for
  three phases after they shipped — in a project whose whole point is that a tool must not
  claim more than it has established. Treat them as code: if a change makes one false, the
  change is not finished.
- Comments explain *why*, and cite a spec section or a measured number where one exists.
  Do not add comments restating what the line does.
- Tests mirror source structure. Test names state the claim being made.
- `uv.lock` **is committed** — see Constraints.

## Constraints

- **Importing `partspec` must not import a CAD engine.** build123d, CadQuery, trimesh,
  manifold3d and OCP load lazily inside their backends. This keeps the parameter phase fast
  and is enforced structurally by the core having zero required dependencies.
- **A backend must never return a plausible-looking number in place of an answer.** If the
  representation lacks the entity, return `Unsupported`. Do not fit, reconstruct, or
  approximate your way to a result — a mesh has no cylindrical face, and inventing one
  produces confident wrong numbers in the unsafe direction.
- **Check the precondition before measuring, and make it narrow** (D17). Volume and centre
  of mass need a closed, consistently-wound surface; genus needs a closed single body; a
  body count needs no edge shared by more than two faces. `bbox`, `area` and `watertight`
  need nothing. This is not paranoia — every one of those returned a confident wrong number
  on an open mesh until 2026-08-05. Equally, do **not** refuse more than the mathematics
  requires: an unnecessary `unsupported` pushes a part to `incomplete`, which is also a way
  of failing to answer an answerable question.
- **Never read an absolute measurement out of a library that rebuilds its input** (D17).
  manifold3d retriangulated 55 of 10,688 triangles on a *clean* part and moved its volume by
  0.078%; measurements taken from it describe its reconstruction, not the exported artifact,
  which D15 forbids. And when such a library reports an error status, believe it —
  manifold3d's rejected objects still answer `.decompose()` and `.genus()`.
- **Do not make the mesh tier depend on scipy.** It reaches a dev machine only through
  build123d/cadquery, so such a dependency passes locally *and* in CI while breaking every
  `pip install partspec[mesh]` user. `just test-mesh-only` is the guard, and CI runs it as
  its own job — it was local-only for a while, which meant the detector for a
  "passes-in-CI" failure was itself absent from CI.
- **A skipped test is not a passing test.** The suite once reported 195 passed / 23 skipped
  in CI because no runner had OpenSCAD, and those 23 were the entire end-to-end path. If you
  add a `skipif` for a missing tool, add the tool to `PARTSPEC_REQUIRE_ENGINES` handling in
  `tests/conftest.py` so CI cannot lose it silently. And **never gate a test module at
  import**: `pytest.importorskip` at module scope raises during collection, so the file
  reports as ONE skipped line and every test in it — including the ones needing nothing —
  leaves the count. Use a per-test `needs_*` marker from `tests/support.py`;
  `test_packaging.py` enforces this and names the three modules that genuinely cannot
  import without their extra.
- **Never let an unevaluated check exit 0.** `Verdict.INCOMPLETE` maps to exit 2 on purpose.
- **Do not add a `--allow-incomplete` flag** without a recorded case where `incomplete` is a
  part's genuine long-term state. Shipping the escape hatch alongside the discipline means
  the discipline is never tested.
- **Pin exactly one OCP provider.** `cadquery-ocp` and `cadquery-ocp-novtk` both own the
  top-level `OCP/` package (326 vs 322 files) and pip does not detect the conflict — one
  silently clobbers the other, and when novtk wins **CadQuery cannot import at all**. A
  `[tool.uv] override-dependencies` marker drops novtk from resolution; `just ocp-guard`
  asserts the outcome in CI. This is also why `uv.lock` is committed rather than ignored.
- **`just setup` installs ALL extras, and CI runs the same recipe.** The lighter mesh-only
  sync produced real CI drift: pyright resolved build123d locally and not in CI, so
  `just check` gave two different answers. If you use `just setup-mesh`, expect `just check`
  to differ from the gate.
- Do not add a dependency without justification; the core is stdlib-only by design.
- Do not commit secrets or credentials.
